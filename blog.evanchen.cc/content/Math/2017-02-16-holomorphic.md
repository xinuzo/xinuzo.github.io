In this post we'll make sense of a holomorphic square root and logarithm.
Wrote this up because I was surprised how hard it was to find a decent complete explanation.

Let $f \colon U \rightarrow \mathbb C$ be a holomorphic function.
A **holomorphic $n$-th root** of $f$ is a function $g \colon U \rightarrow \mathbb C$
such that $f(z) = g(z)^n$ for all $z \in U$.
A **logarithm** of $f$ is a function $g \colon U \rightarrow \mathbb C$ such that
$f(z) = e^{g(z)}$ for all $z \in U$.

The main question we'll try to figure out is: when do these exist?
In particular, what if $f = \operatorname{id}$?

## 1. Motivation: Square Root of a Complex Number

To start us off, can we define $\sqrt z$ for any complex number $z$?

The first obvious problem that comes up is that there for any $z$,
there are _two_ numbers $w$ such that $w^2 = z$. How can we pick one to use?
For our ordinary square root function, we had a notion of "positive", and so we simply took the positive root.

Let's expand on this: given $z = r \left( \cos\theta + i \sin\theta \right)$
(here $r \ge 0$) we should take the root to be
$$w = \sqrt{r} \left( \cos \alpha + i \sin \alpha \right).$$
such that $2\alpha \equiv \theta \pmod{2\pi}$; there are two choices for $\alpha \pmod{2\pi}$,
differing by $\pi$.

For complex numbers, we don't have an obvious way to pick $\alpha$.
Nonetheless, perhaps we can also get away with an arbitrary distinction:
let's see what happens if we just choose the $\alpha$ with $-\frac{1}{2}\pi < \alpha \le \frac{1}{2}\pi$.

Pictured below are some points (in red) and their images (in blue) under this "upper-half" square root.
The condition on $\alpha$ means we are forcing the blue points to lie on the right-half plane.

![Trying to take the square root with positive real component.](./images/holomorphic-log-1.png)

Here, $w_i^2 = z_i$ for each $i$,
and we are constraining the $w_i$ to lie in the right half of the complex plane.
We see there is an obvious issue: there is a big discontinuity near the point $z_5$ and $z_7$!
The nearby point $w_6$ has been mapped very far away.
This discontinuity occurs since the points on the negative real axis are at the "boundary".
For example, given $-4$, we send it to $-2i$, but we have hit the boundary:
in our interval $-\frac{1}{2}\pi \le \alpha < \frac{1}{2}\pi$, we are at the very left edge.

The negative real axis that we must not touch is what we will later call a _branch cut_,
but for now I call it a **ray of death**.
It is a warning to the red points: if you cross this line, you will die!
However, if we move the red circle just a little upwards (so that it misses the
negative real axis) this issue is avoided entirely, and we get what seems to be a "nice" square root.

![Dodging the ray of death by moving upwards a bit.](./images/holomorphic-log-2.png)

In fact, the ray of death is fairly arbitrary:
it is the set of "boundary issues" that arose when we picked $-\frac{1}{2}\pi < \alpha \le \frac{1}{2}\pi$.
Suppose we instead insisted on the interval $0 \le \alpha < \pi$;
then the ray of death would be the _positive_ real axis instead.
The earlier circle we had now works just fine.

![Choosing a different ray of death.](./images/holomorphic-log-3.png)

What we see is that picking a particular $\alpha$-interval leads to a different set of edge cases,
and hence a different ray of death. The only thing these rays have in common is their starting point of zero.
In other words, given a red circle and a restriction of $\alpha$,
I can make a nice "square rooted" blue circle as long as the ray of death misses it.

So, what exactly is going on?

## 2. Square Roots of Holomorphic Functions

To get a picture of what's happening, we would like to consider a more general problem:
let $f \colon U \rightarrow \mathbb C$ be holomorphic.
Then we want to decide whether there is a holomorphic $g \colon U \rightarrow \mathbb C$ such that
$$f(z) = g(z)^2.$$
Our previous discussion when $f = \operatorname{id}$ tells us we cannot hope to achieve this for $U = \mathbb C$;
there is a "half-ray" which causes problems.
However, there are certainly functions $f \colon \mathbb C \rightarrow \mathbb C$ such that a $g$ exists.
As a simplest example, $f(z) = z^2$ should definitely have a square root!

Now let's see if we can fudge together a square root.
Earlier, what we did was try to specify a rule to force one of the two choices at each point.
This is unnecessarily strict.
Perhaps we can do something like the following: start at a point in $z_0 \in U$,
pick a square root $w_0$ of $f(z_0)$,
and then try to "fudge" from there the square roots of the other points. What do I mean by fudge?
Well, suppose $z_1$ is a point very close to $z_0$, and we want to pick a square root $w_1$ of $f(z_1)$.
While there are two choices, we also would expect $w_0$ to be close to $w_1$.
Unless we are highly unlucky, this should tell us which choice of $w_1$ to pick.
(Stupid concrete example: if I have taken the square root $-4.12i$ of $-17$ and
then ask you to continue this square root to $-16$, which sign should you pick for $\pm 4i$?)

There are two possible ways we could get unlucky in the scheme above: first, if $w_0 = 0$, then we're sunk.
But even if we avoid that, we have to worry that we are in a situation,
where we run around a full loop in the complex plane,
and then find that our continuous perturbation has left us in a different place than we started.
For concreteness, consider the following situation, again with $f = \operatorname{id}$:

![The blue circle only completes half a lap.](./images/holomorphic-log-4.png)

We started at the point $z_0$, with one of its square roots as $w_0$.
We then wound a full red circle around the origin, only to find that at the end of it,
the blue arc is at a different place where it started!

The interval construction from earlier doesn't work either: no matter how we pick the interval for $\alpha$,
any ray of death must hit our red circle.
The problem somehow lies with the fact that we have enclosed the very special point $0$.

Nevertheless, we know that if we take $f(z) = z^2$,
then we don't run into any problems with our "make it up as you go" procedure. So, what exactly is going on?

## 3. Covering Projections

By now, if you have read the part of algebraic topology. this should all seem very strangely familiar.
The "fudging" procedure exactly describes the idea of a lifting.

More precisely, recall that there is a covering projection
$$(-)^2 \colon \mathbb C \setminus \{0\} \rightarrow \mathbb C \setminus \{0\}$$
Let $V = \left\{ z \in U \mid f(z) \neq 0 \right\}$.
For $z \in U \setminus V$, we already have the square root $g(z) = \sqrt{f(z)} = \sqrt 0 = 0$.
So the burden is completing $g \colon V \rightarrow \mathbb C$.

Then essentially, what we are trying to do is construct a lifting $g$ for the following diagram:

![Covering projection for square function.](./images/cproj-square.png)

Our map $p$ can be described as "winding around twice".
From algebraic topology, we now know that this lifting exists if and only if
$$f_\ast(\pi_1(V)) \subseteq p_\ast(\pi_1(E))$$
is a subset of the image of $\pi_1(E)$ by $p$.
Since $B$ and $E$ are both punctured planes, we can identify them with $S^1$.

> **Exercise 1**
>
> Show that the image under $p$ is exactly $2\mathbb Z$ once we identify $\pi_1(B) = \mathbb Z$.

That means that for any loop $\gamma$ in $V$,
we need $f \circ \gamma$ to have an _even_ winding number around $0 \in B$. This amounts to
$$\frac{1}{2\pi} \oint_\gamma \frac{f'}{f} dz \in 2\mathbb Z$$
since $f$ has no poles.

Replacing $2$ with $n$ and carrying over the discussion gives the first main result.

> $$\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_\gamma \frac{f'}{f} dz \in n\mathbb Z$$
> for every contour $\gamma$ in $U$.

## 4. Complex Logarithms

The multivalued nature of the complex logarithm comes from the fact that
$$\exp(z+2\pi i) = \exp(z).$$
So if $e^w = z$, then any complex number $w + 2\pi i k$ is also a solution.

We can handle this in the same way as before: it amounts to a lifting of the following diagram.

![Covering projection for exponential function.](./images/cproj-exp.png)

There is no longer a need to work with a separate $V$ since:

> **Exercise 3**
>
> Show that if $f$ has any zeros then $g$ possibly can't exist.

In fact, the map $\exp \colon \mathbb C \rightarrow \mathbb C\setminus\{0\}$ is a universal cover,
since $\mathbb C$ is simply connected. Thus, $p(\pi_1(\mathbb C))$ is _trivial_.
So in addition to being zero-free, $f$ cannot have any winding number around $0 \in B$ at all. In other words:

>
> <span id="thmholomorphic_log"></span> Let $f \colon U \rightarrow \mathbb C$ be holomorphic.
> Then $f$ has a logarithm if and only if
> $$\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_\gamma \frac{f'}{f} dz = 0$$
> for every contour $\gamma$ in $U$.

## 5. Some Special Cases

The most common special case is

>
> <span id="cornonvanishing"></span> Let $f \colon \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb C$ be continuous,
> where $\Omega$ is simply connected.
> If $f(z) \neq 0$ for every $z \in \Omega$, then $f$ has both a logarithm and holomorphic $n$-th root.

Finally, let's return to the question of $f = \operatorname{id}$ from the very beginning.
What's the best domain $U$ such that we can define $\sqrt{-} \colon U \rightarrow \mathbb C$?
Clearly $U = \mathbb C$ cannot be made to work, but we can do almost as well.
For note that the only zero of $f = \operatorname{id}$ is at the origin.
Thus, if we want to make a logarithm exist,
all we have to do is make an incision in the complex plane that renders it
impossible to make a loop around the origin.
The usual choice is to delete negative half of the real axis, our very first ray of death;
we call this a **branch cut**,
with **branch point** at $0 \in \mathbb C$ (the point which we cannot circle around). This gives

There are many possible choices of such functions ($n$ choices for the $n$-th
root and infinitely many for $\log$); a choice of such a function is called a **branch**.
So this is what is meant by a "branch" of a logarithm.

The **principal branch** is the "canonical" branch,
analogous to the way we arbitrarily pick the positive branch to define
$\sqrt{-} \colon \mathbb R_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb R_{\ge 0}$.
For $\log$, we take the $w$ such that $e^w = z$ and the imaginary part of $w$
lies in $(-\pi, \pi]$ (since we can shift by integer multiples of $2\pi i$).
Often, authors will write $\operatorname{Log} z$ to emphasize this choice.
