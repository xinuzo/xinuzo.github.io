This is a transcript of a talk I gave as part of MIT's 18.434 class,
the "Seminar in Theoretical Computer Science" as part of [MIT's communication
requirement](http://web.mit.edu/commreq/cim/course18.html).
(Insert snarky comment about MIT's CI-\* requirements here.) It probably would
have made a nice math circle talk for high schoolers but I felt somewhat awkward
having to present it to a bunch of students who were clearly older than me.

## 1. Preliminaries

### 1.1. Modular arithmetic

In middle school you might have encountered questions such as

> **Exercise 1.** What is $3^{2016} \pmod{10}$?

You could answer such questions by listing out $3^n$ for small $n$ and then finding a pattern,
in this case of period $4$. However, for large moduli this "brute-force" approach can be time-consuming.

Fortunately, it turns out that one can predict the period in advance.

> **Theorem 2** **(Euler's little theorem)**
>
> 1. Let $\gcd(a,n) = 1$. Then $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod n$.
> 2. (Fermat) If $p$ is a prime, then $a^p \equiv a \pmod p$ for every $a$.

_Proof:_ Part (a) is a special case of Lagrange's Theorem: if $G$ is a finite group and $g \in G$,
then $g^{|G|}$ is the identity element. Now select $G = (\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z)^\times$.
Part (b) is the case $n=p$. $\Box$

Thus, in the middle school problem we know in advance that $3^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$ because $\phi(10) = 4$.
This bound is sharp for primes:

> **Theorem 3** **(Primitive roots)**
>
> For every $p$ prime there's a $g \pmod p$ such that $g^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod p$
> but $g^{k} \not\equiv 1 \pmod p$ for any $k < p-1$.
> (Hence $(\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z)^\times \cong \mathbb Z/(p-1)$.)

For a proof, see the last exercise of [my orders
handout](https://web.evanchen.cc/handouts/ORPR/ORPR.pdf).

We will define the following anyways:

> **Definition 4.** We say an integer $n$ (thought of as an exponent) **annihilates** the prime $p$ if
>
> - $a^n \equiv 1 \pmod p$ for every $a \not\equiv 0 \pmod p$,
> - or equivalently, $p-1 \mid n$.

> **Theorem 5** **(All/nothing)**
>
> Suppose an exponent $n$ does not annihilate the prime $p$.
> Then more than $\frac{1}{2} p$ of $x \pmod p$ satisfy $x^n \not\equiv 1 \pmod p$.

_Proof:_ Much stronger result is true: in $x^n \equiv 1 \pmod p$ then $x^{\gcd(n,p-1)} \equiv 1 \pmod p$.
$\Box$

### 1.2. Repeated Exponentiation

Even without the previous facts, one can still do:

> **Theorem 6** **(Repeated exponentiation)**
>
> Given $x$ and $n$, one can compute $x^n \pmod N$ with $O(\log n)$ multiplications mod $N$.

The idea is that to compute $x^{600} \pmod N$, one just multiplies $x^{512+64+16+8}$.
All the $x^{2^k}$ can be computed in $k$ steps, and $k \le \log_2 n$.

### 1.3. Chinese remainder theorem

In the middle school problem, we might have noticed that to compute $3^{2016} \pmod{10}$,
it suffices to compute it modulo $5$, because we already know it is odd.
More generally, to understand $\pmod n$ it suffices to understand $n$ modulo each of its prime powers.

The formal statement, which we include for completeness, is:

> **Theorem 7** **(Chinese remainder theorem)**
>
> Let $p_1$, $p_2$, …, $p_m$ be distinct primes, and $e_i \ge 1$ integers.
> Then there is a ring isomorphism given by the natural projection
> $$\mathbb Z/n \rightarrow \prod_{i=1}^m \mathbb Z/p_i^{e_i}.$$
> In particular, a random choice of $x \pmod n$ amounts to a random choice of $x$ mod each prime power.

For an example, in the following table we see the natural bijection between
$x \pmod{15}$ and $(x \pmod 3, x \pmod 5)$.

$$
\begin{array}{c|cc} x \pmod{15} & x \pmod{3} & x \pmod{5} \\ \hline 0 & 0 & 0
\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 2 & 2 & 2 \\ 3 & 0 & 3 \\ 4 & 1 & 4 \\ 5 & 2 & 0 \\ 6 & 0 & 1 \\
7 & 1 & 2 \end{array} \quad \begin{array}{c|cc} x \pmod{15} & x \pmod{3} & x
\pmod{5} \\ \hline 8 & 2 & 3 \\ 9 & 0 & 4 \\ 10 & 1 & 0 \\ 11 & 2 & 1 \\ 12 & 0
& 2 \\ 13 & 1 & 3 \\ 14 & 2 & 4 \\ && \end{array}
$$

## 2. The RSA algorithm

This simple number theory is enough to develop the so-called RSA algorithm.
Suppose Alice wants to send Bob a message $M$ over an insecure channel. They can do so as follows.

- Bob selects integers $d$, $e$ and $N$ (with $N$ huge) such that $N$ is a semiprime and

  $$de \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(N)}.$$

- Bob publishes both the number $N$ and $e$ (the **public key**) but keeps the
  number $d$ secret (the **private key**).

- Alice sends the number $X = M^e \pmod N$ across the channel.

- Bob computes

  $$X^d \equiv M^{de} \equiv M^1 \equiv M \pmod N$$
  and hence obtains the message $M$.

In practice, the $N$ in RSA is at least $2000$ bits long.

The trick is that an adversary cannot compute $d$ from $e$ and $N$ without
knowing the prime factorization of $N$. So the security relies heavily on the difficulty of factoring.

> **Remark 8.** It turns out that we basically don't know how to factor large numbers $N$:
> the best known classical algorithms can factor an $n$-bit number in
> $$O\left( \exp\left( \frac{64}{9} n \log(n)^2 \right)^{1/3} \right)$$
> time ("general number field sieve").
> On the other hand, with a _quantum_ computer one can do this in
> $O\left( n^2 \log n \log \log n \right)$ time.

## 3. Primality Testing

Main question: if we can't factor a number $n$ quickly, can we at least check it's prime?

In what follows, **we assume for simplicity that $n$ is squarefree**, i.e.
$n = p_1 p_2 \dots p_k$ for distinct primes $p_k$, This doesn't substantially change anything,
but it makes my life much easier.

### 3.1. Co-RP

Here is the goal: we need to show there is a random algorithm $A$ which does the following.

- If $n$ is composite then
  - More than half the time $A$ says "definitely composite".
  - Occasionally, $A$ says "possibly prime".
- If $n$ is prime, $A$ always says "possibly prime".

If there is a polynomial time algorithm $A$ that does this, we say that PRIMES is in Co-RP.
Clearly, this is a very good thing to be true!

### 3.2. Fermat

One idea is to try to use the converse of Fermat's little theorem: given an integer $n$,
pick a random number $x \pmod n$ and see if $x^{n-1} \equiv 1 \pmod n$.
(We compute using repeated exponentiation.) If not, then we know for sure $n$ is not prime,
and we call $x$ a **Fermat witness** modulo $n$.

How good is this test? For most composite $n$, pretty good:

> **Proposition 9.** Let $n$ be composite.
> Assume that there is a prime $p \mid n$ such that $n-1$ does not annihilate $p$.
> Then over half the numbers mod $n$ are Fermat witnesses.

_Proof:_ Apply the Chinese theorem then the "all-or-nothing" theorem. $\Box$
Unfortunately, if $n$ doesn't satisfy the hypothesis,
then _all_ the $\gcd(x,n) = 1$ satisfy $x^{n-1} \equiv 1 \pmod n$!

Are there such $n$ which aren't prime?
Such numbers are called **Carmichael numbers**, but unfortunately they exist,
the first one is $561 = 3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17$.

> **Remark 10.** For $X \gg 1$, there are more than $X^{1/3}$ Carmichael numbers at most $X$.

Thus these numbers are very rare, but they foil the Fermat test.

> **Exercise 11.** Show that a Carmichael number is not a semiprime.

### 3.3. Rabin-Miller

Fortunately, we can adapt the Fermat test to cover Carmichael numbers too.
It comes from the observation that if $n$ is prime,
then $a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod n \implies a \equiv \pm 1 \pmod n$.

So let $n-1 = 2^s t$, where $t$ is odd. For example, if $n = 561$ then $560 = 2^4 \cdot 35$.
Then we compute $x^t$, $x^{2t}$, …, $x^{n-1}$. For example in the case $n=561$ and $x=245$:

$$
\begin{array}{c|r|rrr} & \mod 561 & \mod 3 & \mod 11 & \mod 17 \\ \hline x &
245 & -1 & 3 & 7 \\ \hline x^{35} & 122 & -1 & \mathbf 1 & 3 \\ x^{70} & 298 &
\mathbf 1 & 1 & 9 \\ x^{140} & 166 & 1 & 1 & -4 \\ x^{280} & 67 & 1 & 1 & -1 \\
x^{560} & 1 & 1 & 1 & \mathbf 1 \end{array}
$$

And there we have our example! We have $67^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{561}$, so $561$ isn't prime.

So the Rabin-Miller test works as follows:

- Given $n$, select a random $x$ and compute powers of $x$ as in the table.
- If $x^{n-1} \not\equiv 1$, stop, $n$ is composite (Fermat test).
- If $x^{n-1} \equiv 1$, see if the entry just before the first $1$ is $-1$.
  If it isn't then we say $x$ is a **RM-witness** and $n$ is composite.
- Otherwise, $n$ is "possibly prime".

How likely is probably?

> **Theorem 12.** If $n$ is Carmichael, then over half the $x \pmod n$ are RM witnesses.

_Proof:_ We sample $x \pmod n$ randomly again by looking modulo each prime (Chinese theorem).
By the theorem on primitive roots,
show that the probability the first $-1$ appears in any given row is $\le \frac{1}{2}$.
This implies the conclusion. $\Box$

> **Exercise 13.** Improve the $\frac{1}{2}$ in the problem to $\frac34$ by
> using the fact that Carmichael numbers aren't semiprime.

### 3.4. AKS

In August 6, 2002, it was in fact shown that PRIMES is in P, using the deterministic AKS algorithm.
However, in practice everyone still uses Miller-Rabin since the implied constants for AKS runtime are large.
